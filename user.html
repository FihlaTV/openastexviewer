<!--#set var="TITLE" value="User commands in OpenAstexViewer" -->

OpenAstexViewer provides support for extending the scripting language
with arbitrary commands. This document covers an example of this.

<p>If the command part of a scripting command is not recognized a
class file of that name is search for. If this is found an instance is
created using reflection, and the static method handleCommand is
called with a reference to the MoleculeViewer, the MoleculeRenderer
and the argument list.

<p>The command can do quite complicated things. The example below
creates an instance of itself which is a subclass of GraphicalObject.
This starts a thread which will animate the renderer. The object
steps through the atoms that were passed as part of the command,
and draws a green sphere in turn at the position of each atom.

<p>The command would be used something like

<pre>
animated -name calpha -atoms { atom CA };
</pre>

<p>Note the '{' and '}' characters that enclose the atom selection.
These are important for the parser in commands that have arbitrary
argument lists.
