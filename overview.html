<p>OpenAstexViewer is a Java molecular graphics program that
assists in structure based drug design. It can be used as an Applet in
a web page or as a desktop application. The software should run on
most operating systems and in most internet
browsers. OpenAstexViewer has been used most extensively in
Internet Explorer v5+ running on Microsoft Windows. The software is
known to run as an Applet within the Safari browser on Mac OS X.

<ul>

<li>AstexViewer&trade; was originally developed by Mike Hartshorn at Astex Therapeutics
between 1999 and 2007.

<li>The software was shaped by the input of many people from the structural biology and
computational chemistry groups at Astex Therapeutics.

<ul>

<li>Version 1 was made available via the Astex Therapeutics web site and published in
JCAMD from 2002.

<li>Version 2 was made available via the website from 2004.

</ul>

<li>OpenAstexViewer was made available with support from <a style='text-decoration:

(M.J.Hartshorn, JCAMD, <b>16</b>, 871 (2002)). New functionality
includes

<ul>
<li> Sphere, cylinder and stick display styles for molecules.</li>
<li> Versatile labelling and distance monitors.</li>
<li> Shaded molecular surfaces, with transparency and property mapping.</li>
<li> Protein schematics and secondary structure assignment.</li>
<li> High quality image production to arbitrary resolution, with antialiasing and shadows.</li>
</ul>

<p> The following pages show examples of the use of
OpenAstexViewer for displaying protein/ligand complexes.

<ul>
<li> An <a href="thinlet.html">applet</a> using the internal Java graphical user interface.
<li> An <a href="jsinterface.html">applet</a> using HTML and Javascript controls.
<li> An <a href="multiple.html">example</a> that displays multiple structures.
</ul>
