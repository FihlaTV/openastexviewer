It can be used as an Applet in a web page or as a desktop application. The software should run on most operating systems and in most internet browsers. OpenAstexViewer has been used most extensively in Internet Explorer v5+ running on Microsoft Windows. The software is known to run as an Applet within the Safari browser on Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nAstexViewer™ was originally developed by Mike Hartshorn at Astex Therapeutics between 1999 and 2007.\r\nThe software was shaped by the input of many people from the structural biology and computational chemistry groups at Astex Therapeutics.\r\nVersion 1 was made available via the Astex Therapeutics web site and published in JCAMD from 2002.\r\nVersion 2 was made available via the website from 2004.\r\nOpenAstexViewer was made available with support from Astex Therapeutics, GlaxoSmithKline and dotmatics Limited.\r\nOpenAstexViewer 3.0 is a major upgrade of the software first described in the original publication (M.J.Hartshorn, JCAMD, 16, 871 (2002)). New functionality includes\r\n\r\nSphere, cylinder and stick display styles for molecules.\r\nVersatile labelling and distance monitors.\r\nShaded molecular surfaces, with transparency and property mapping.\r\nProtein schematics and secondary structure assignment.\r\nHigh quality image production to arbitrary resolution, with antialiasing and shadows.\r\nThe following pages show examples of the use of OpenAstexViewer for displaying protein/ligand complexes.\r\n\r\nAn applet using the internal Java graphical user interface.\r\nAn applet using HTML and Javascript controls.\r\nAn example that displays multiple structures.\r\nOpenAstexViewer may be downloaded from this website subject to acceptance of the terms and conditions of the licence agreement on the Download page.
