<!--#set var="TITLE" value="Installing OpenAstexViewer" -->
<!--#include file="header.inc" -->

This document gives instructions for installing OpenAstexViewer as an
application and as an applet. OpenAstexViewer is supplied as a single
<code>jar</code> file
(</code>OpenAstexViewer.jar</code>) that includes all of the executable
code and a variety of other resources (such as images and data files)
that are used by the program.

<p>To use OpenAstexViewer you will need to have a Java runtime environment
installed on your computer. OpenAstexViewer will work with Java 1.1 and
newer versions of the Java runtime.

<h2>Installing OpenAstexViewer for Windows</h2>

There is no automated installer for OpenAstexViewer. However, the
installation process is fairly simple.

<p>You should decide on a location for the OpenAstexViewer <code>jar</code>
file (OpenAstexViewer.jar). You should then edit the windows batch file
that will run OpenAstexViewer. Typically this would be called
<code>OpenAstexViewer.bat</code> and would look something like the
following. You need to edit the two paths that are defined near the
top of the file. The first is the location of the java runtime that
will be used to run OpenAstexViewer. This can be installed on a
network drive so that everyones OpenAstexViewer will use the same
java runtime. The second thing you need to edit is the path to the
location of the OpenAstexViewer jar file. This is defined by the
CLASSPATH variable.

<pre>
@echo off

set java=c:\jdk1.1.8

set CLASSPATH=v:\OpenAstexViewer.jar

%java%\bin\java -mx600Mb astex.MoleculeViewer %1 %2 %3 %4 %5
</pre>

<p>When you have done this you should be able to run OpenAstexViewer by
double clicking the batch file, or by dragging a pdb or mol file onto
the link, in Windows explorer.

<p>The best way to maintain a shared installation of OpenAstexViewer is to
setup all of the components (java, OpenAstexViewer jar file and the bat
file) on a shared network area. Then the installation process is as
simple as creating a short cut to the batch file on the users
desktop. In this way the jar file or the java implementation can be
updated centrally.

<h2>Installing OpenAstexViewer for Linux</h2>

A similar procedure can be used for running OpenAstexViewer as an
application under Linux (or other Unix operating systems). In this
case the unix command file might look something like the following.

<pre>
#!/bin/csh -f

setenv JAVA	/usr/local/java/

setenv CLASSPATH /usr/local/astexviewer2/OpenAstexViewer.jar

$JAVA/bin/java -mx600Mb astex.MoleculeViewer $*
</pre>

<h2>Using OpenAstexViewer as a Browser Applet</h2>

OpenAstexViewer will run in a browser equipped with a Java
virtual machine. It has been most extensively tested using
Internet Explorer version 6 on Windows 2000, but is known
to work on other browser/platform configurations.

<p>To include OpenAstexViewer in a web page, you need to create an applet
in your html document. There is an <a
href="../applet/index.html">example</a> of this provided in the
distribution.

<p>Essentially you create an applet that references the OpenAstexViewer
<code>jar</code> file and the <code>MoleculeViewerApplet</code>
class. A number of parameters can be specified to control what
molecules are loaded and how they are displayed.

<pre>
&lt;applet
	width="640" height="480" name="av"
	code="MoleculeViewerApplet"
	codebase=".."
	archive="OpenAstexViewer.jar"&gt;
      &lt;param name="scriptFile" value="621p.script"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>

<p>The name argument controls how the applet can be referenced in
Javascript interfaces. In the example above you would refer to this
applet as <code>document.av</code>.

<p>The <code>codebase</code> tag indicates the location of the
<code>jar</code> file. This must be accessible on the server that the
webpage was downloaded from.

<p>The <code>scriptFile</code> parameter specifies the name of a
script of OpenAstexViewer commands to run at startup. Alternatively, you
can specify a parameter called <code>script</code> whose value is an
explicit string of OpenAstexViewer commands to run at startup.

<p>The applet has a few methods that are exposed to Javascript. These
are described in the Javadoc for the
<a href="../javadoc/MoleculeViewerApplet.html">MoleculeViewerApplet</a>
class. The most useful are

<dl>

<dt>void execute(String s)

<dd>This will cause OpenAstexViewer to execute the commands passed as a string.

<dt>String fetch(String url)

<dd>OpenAstexViewer will open the URL and return the contents as a string.
Default security for applets means that they can only open URL's on
the server that they came from. The URL can be a cgi/php/jsp program
that can carry out arbitrary actions on the server.

<dt>String getView()

<dd>Will return a string of OpenAstexViewer commands that will recreate
the center, radius and orientation matrix of the current view. This
can be useful for recreating sessions.

<dt>String getColor(int x, int y)

<dd>This will popup OpenAstexViewer's internal color chooser dialog centered on the specified
x, y coordinates (care is taken to keep the dialog on screen). This is a useful way to get a
custom color for javascript applications. The chosen color is returned in a format suitable
for use in OpenAstexViewer scripting commands or html.
