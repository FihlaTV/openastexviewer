This document provides some examples of how to get at the basic nuts
and bolts of the API programming. The best source of examples is the
OpenAstexViewer source code and the javadoc will describe all of the
classes and methods.

<ol>

<li>With a reference to the MoleculeViewer, you need to get the
MoleculeRenderer which actually manages the molecules.

<pre>
MoleculeRenderer mr = moleculeViewer.getMoleculeRenderer();
</pre>

<li>The MoleculeRenderer gives you access to the molecules and
their constituents.

<pre>
int molCount = mr.getMoleculeCount()

for(int i = 0; i < molCount; i++){
    Molecule mol = mr.getMolecule(i);
}
</pre>

Lets you get at the number and individual molecules.

<p>When you have a molecule you can turn it on/off with
mol.setDisplayed(0/1/2);

<p>0 and 1 do what you would expect. 2 indicates toggle (if its on,
turn it off and vice versa). When a molecule is off it is completely
skipped in the renderering process.  Any distance monitors should not
be drawn to atoms in an off molecule.<p>

<li>If you just want to walk through the whole atom list for the
MoleculeRenderer you can get an iterator, which will go through all
molecules, chains, residues etc.

<pre>
AtomIterator ai = mr.getAtomIterator();

while(ai.hasMoreElements()){
    Atom a = ai.getNextAtom();
}
</pre>

getNextAtom() is a convenience method that calls getNextElement and
casts it for you.

<p>a.getElement() will give you the atomic number of the atom.

<p>If you want to go through the molecular data structure long hand
for some reason you can do it like this.

<pre>
for(int m = 0; m < mr.getMoleculeCount(); m++){
  Molecule molecule = mr.getMolecule(m);

  for(int c = 0; c < molecule.getChainCount(); c++){
     Chain chain = molecule.getChain(c);

     for(int r = 0; r < chain.getResidueCount(); r++){
        Residue residue = chain.getResidue(r);
        int atomCount = residue.getAtomCount();

        for(int a = 0; a < atomCount; a++){
          Atom atom = residue.getAtom(a);
        }
     }
  }
}
</pre>

<li>Selecting atoms. When you have a reference to an atom just call
setSelected(true/false). Selected atoms get the yellow dot when
drawn. You can check if atoms are selected with isSelected();
<p>

<li>If you want a list of all the atoms that are currently selected
(you might have been using the user interface or building up a
selection by some other means)

<pre>
DynamicArray selectedAtoms = mr.getSelectedAtoms();
</pre>

Then you can just go through these with

<pre>
int count = selectedAtoms.size();

for(int i = 0; i < count; i++){
    Atom a = (Atom)selectedAtoms.get(i);
}
</pre>
<p>

<li>Display styles. This is usually all done through scriping language
so there is no method call to do it (... obviously there should be).

<p>So you get to do it directly. There is an attributes int in the
atom. The render styles are (Atom.Displayed = lines, Atom.VDWSphere,
Atom.Cylinder, Atom.BallAndStick) you just set them in the usual way

<pre>
Atom a;
int style;

a.attributes |= style; // to turn on
a.attributes &= ~style; // to turn off
</pre>

There are various other methods on atom that let you change the radii
of all the display styles.
<p>

<li>The renderer. If you want to create you own display objects you
will need to use the actual low level renderer directly. This is referenced just as

<pre>
Renderer r = mr.renderer;
</pre>

Obviously there should be a method call for that. But more generally
the way the MoleculeRenderer and the Renderer interact is not done
quite right. This may well change in the near future.

<p>On the renderer there are some methods for drawing different
primitives. You should use the ones that take coordinates as double
precision numbers. These are just world coordinates.

<pre>
drawLine(double x1, double y1, double z1,
         double x2, double y2, double z2,
         int rgb1, int rgb2, int pixelWidth)

drawCylinder(double x1, double y1, double z1,
             double x2, double y2, double z2,
             int rgb1, int rgb2, double r)

drawSphere(double x, double y, double z, double r,
           int rgb, int transp)

drawString(double x, double y, double z,
           double zoff, int color, String string)
</pre>

(zoff is an offset in the z-direction that is applied post
transformation, so you can make things like labels always appear in front
of a vdw sphere for example- see the scripting language for the string
prefix notation that lets you control how the string is rendered.).
<p>

<li>When you have changed anything through this API you must call
<code>moleculeRenderer.repaint()</code>.  This causes the
MoleculeViewer to update itself, but also tells it that it actually
needs to regenerate the picture.  Otherwise it just copies what it had
last time back to the Graphics object.
